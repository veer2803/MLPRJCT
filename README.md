# 🛡️ Explainable Phishing Email Detection System

DistilBERT-based spam/phishing detector with token-level explainability.

## 📁 Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `train_bert.py` | Fine-tune DistilBERT on your spam.csv dataset |
| `predictor.py` | Inference engine + explainability + feature engineering |
| `app.py` | Streamlit web interface |
| `requirements.txt` | Dependencies |

## 🚀 Setup & Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. Put your spam.csv in the same folder
# 3. Train the model  (~10–20 min on CPU, ~3 min on GPU)
python train_bert.py
# 4. Launch the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 Why BERT is better than TF-IDF + Random Forest

| | Old (TF-IDF + RF) | New (BERT) |
|---|---|---|
| Context understanding | ❌ Bag of words | ✅ Full sentence context |
| Short message detection | ❌ Needs 4-5 keywords | ✅ Works with 2-3 words |
| Preprocessing consistency | ❌ Train/predict mismatch | ✅ Tokenizer handles it |
| Explainability | ❌ None | ✅ Token attribution |
| URL awareness | ❌ None | ✅ Domain mismatch detection |
